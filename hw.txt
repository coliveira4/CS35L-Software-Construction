Q: Suppose the other teams really had been observing all the bytes going across the network.
Is your resulting network still secure? If so, explain why, and explain whether your 
answer would change if (1) you assumed the other teams had also tapped your keyboards 
after you completed all client-server setup and had thereby obtained your team's 
keystrokes during later operation, or (2) you are booting off USB and you assume 
the other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB. If not, explain any
weaknesses of your team's setups, focusing on possible attacks by such outside
observers.

A: If the other teams had access to every byte going across
the network, including mine, the resulting network would still
be secure. This is because the bytes would be encrypted with the
public and private keys so they would not be able to gain insight
on my activity. However, If (1) the other teams had access to 
my keystrokes, they would then have access to my passwords! they would
then be able to decrypt my data using the keys since they would now be
 able to access them, this is why we need to keep our passwords safe!
Additionally, If the other teams had temporary physical control over my USB,
then my data would also be insecure beach they could access my public and 
private keys this way and be able to encrypt and decrypt my data.

Explain why the gpg2 --verify command in the following instructions doesn't 
really verify that you personally created the file in question. How would you 
go about fixing this problem?

the --verify option only verifies the signature with the public key. It does not
however check who created the file. This is a vulnerability since anyone could access
 your public key and generate a signature from it. this could be fixed by generating
the signature using the private key, then no-one except you, unless they had the password,
could generate a signature.
