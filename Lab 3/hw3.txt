Assignment 3: Modifying and Rewriting Keystrokes-HW Questions

Q1.It improves the performance of ls in that it allows it to
 comply with the new guidelines for overwriting -f with -A. 
It might be a "worse" implementation if this was not your 
intention, but it is always better to have one standard to follow
so that those kind of mistakes do not happen, so overall, 
this patch improves the reliability and robustness of ls.

Q2. As mentioned, you need to make sure this is your 
intention, since this is a new standard. If you use this patch and
someone doesn't know about it, they might still think 
that the old way works and implement the command incorrectly.

Q3. When the script randline.py is invoked on an empty file
 like /dev/null, An out of bounds error (IndexError: 
list index out of range) is returned because thescript 
expects the file to contain lines, and and empty file does not.

Q4.When this script is invoked with python3, (python3 randline.py 
/dev/null), An error is still thrown, but this time a
syntax error (SyntaxError: invalid syntax). This is 
because online python2, python 3 does not accept tuple parameters.
